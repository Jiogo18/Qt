All my Qt code

Find your program and pick every DLL you need: If the program need DLL with "d" to the end (Qt5Widgetsd.dll) find here https://www.dll-files.com/
else, some dll has uploaded in Qt/DLL

if you do not know which dll to take, download and start the .exe and add every dll that the program want with a critical box.
Ask me with some dll aren't on Qt/DLL

Some program are created with Qt5.11.0 MinGW 32bit on Windows 10
